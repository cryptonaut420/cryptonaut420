Full-stack developer and serial builder. I make things work.

### Background

- Full-stack generalist - If you can imagine it, I can build it
- Crypto infrastructure since 2012, AI-focused since 2019
- Deep into LLM integrations, agentic workflows, and AI-augmented development
- Co-founded **Tokenly Inc.** (tokenization before Ethereum) and **All Your Feeds** (AI news aggregation pre-GPT)
- Business-oriented: startups, freelance, team lead, and running a multi-location VR arcade business


### What I Do

I work at the bleeding edge — taking projects from 0 to 1, building MVPs, scaling infrastructure, and solving any challenge that comes my way.

Currently exploring decentralized identity, AI-augmented development, and whatever interesting problem comes next.

### Tech

TypeScript, React, Node.js, PHP, Python, Go — plus whatever else the problem requires. Databases, infrastructure, web3, the whole stack.

### Work With Me

Building something ambitious? I'm a mercenary for tech startups and projects that need senior firepower.
